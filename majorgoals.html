<p>My name is Vineeth. My 2018 is neither too good or bad. Not too good is because I have'nt learnt anything perfectly and completely. But towards the end of the year I was clear of what I am gonna be doing in 2019 which makes me feel good about 2018. Friendship with right person has made 2018 year purposeful. I've never met a person who is as good as him. He has shown me right path. And always helped me    when I was in need of one. I'am looking forward for great things in 2019.I want to develop some keys skills for programmer at the same time skills that come in handy in my career and personal life aswell.</p>
<p>The things and skills I want to to develop will boil down to two categories 1) Programming 2) Other IMP skills.
